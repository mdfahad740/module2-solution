 			<div id="sus">Sushi</div>
 			<p>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi ("salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[4] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated (shi) terminal-form conjugation, sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb sui "to be sour" the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.</p>
